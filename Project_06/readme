The assembler projects consists of two separate lisp source files created and tested using CLISP.'

The first is parser.lisp, which handles all the file parsing -related tasks
The second is assembler.lisp, which handles the assembling part

Both of them are in their own packages (named parser and assembler).
The assembler package uses the parser package's public interface.
The assembler package exports the assemble function as its public interface.
Thus, when loading the parser and the assembler into the lisp system, to assemble a file, one simply types in:
(assemble "path\\and\\file_name.asm")
The result is output to similarly named file_name.hack -file in the same directory.
